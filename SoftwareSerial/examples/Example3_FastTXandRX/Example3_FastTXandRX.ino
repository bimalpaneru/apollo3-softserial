  This example shows how to send characters at 19200bps. It's counter intuitive
  but by printing faster and receiving faster we can do more with interrupt
  based software serial.
  Any pin can be used for TX or RX.

  Hardware Connections:
  Attach a USB to serial converter (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15096)
  Connect
    GND on SerialBasic <-> GND on Artemis
    RXO on SerialBasic <-> Pin 8 on Artemis
    TXO on SerialBasic <-> Pin 7 on Artemis
  Load this code
  Open Arduino serial monitor at 115200
  Open Terminal window (TeraTerm) at 19200
  Press a button in terminal window, you should see it in Arduino monitor
*/

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
SoftwareSerial mySerial(D7, D8); //RX, TX - Any pins can be used

int counter = 0;

void setup() {
  //We set the serial monitor speed high so that we spend less time printing the output
  //and more time checking mySerial.available()
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("Software Serial Example");

  mySerial.begin(19200);
}

void loop() {

  mySerial.print("Hi: ");
  mySerial.println(counter++);

  while (mySerial.available())
  {
    byte incoming = mySerial.read();
    Serial.write(incoming);
  }

  delay(25); //Small delay between prints so that we can detect incoming chars if any
}
