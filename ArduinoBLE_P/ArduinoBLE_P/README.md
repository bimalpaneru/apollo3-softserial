# ArduinoBLE_P - special for 1.2.1  (paulvha / February 2021)

# Update October 2022: update and tested on V1.2.3
This is based on ArduinoBLE 1.1.3, but adjusted for Sparkfun library V1.2.3 next to that a number of changes have been applied. (see extras folder)
For installation instruction also see extras folder.

A peripheral example10 has been added with a menu structure and sending sensor data(BME280)
A central example10 has been added to work with the peripheral example10

[![Compile Examples Status](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/workflows/Compile%20Examples/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/actions?workflow=Compile+Examples) [![Spell Check Status](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/workflows/Spell%20Check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/actions?workflow=Spell+Check)

Enables BLE connectivity on the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, Arduino Nano 33 IoT, and Arduino Nano 33 BLE.

This library supports creating a BLE peripheral and BLE central mode.

For the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, and Arduino Nano 33 IoT boards, it requires the NINA module to be running [Arduino NINA-W102 firmware](https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw) v1.2.0 or later.
