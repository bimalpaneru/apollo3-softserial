# Apollo3 IOS

## ===========================================================

IOS stands for Input Output Slave. In short to use a board with an Apollo3 chip as a slave device  either supporting SPI or I2C communication. It is the counter part of the Apollo3 Input Output Master (IOM).

In the SparkFun library there is no implemented use for IOS while in the AMBIQ SDK there are 2 examples. Both of them have the major function defined in the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), but not all of them.

I wondered why there is no better implementation and also wanted to better understand how a slave device would work.

Hence this project. Iâ€™ll share my learning, observation and make sure to read my conclusion.

## Getting Started
There are 4 examples:

<br>Example1_IOS_I2C_Peripheral, to be loaded on an Artemis ATP board.
<br>Example1_IOS_I2C_host, can be loaded to many different boards.

<br>Example2_IOS_SPI_Peripheral, to be loaded on an Artemis ATP board.
<br>Example1_IOS_SPI_host, can be loaded to many different boards.

<br>See top of sketches for the hardware connections.

## Prerequisites
Examples depend on the SparkFun BME280 library

## Software installation
Copy this folder to SparkFun/hardware/apollo3/libraries

## Program usage
Please see the description in the top of the sketch and read the documentation Apollo3-IOS.odt. This can be openend with nearly any word document processor.
