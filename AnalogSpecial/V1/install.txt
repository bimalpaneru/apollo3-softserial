******** INSTALLATION ****************************

On my linux system in the folder :  ~/.arduino15/packages/SparkFun/hardware/apollo3/1.2.3/cores/arduino/ard_sup/analog
On Windows I would expect <userdir>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\Sparkfun\hardware\apollo3\1.2.3\cores\arduino\ard_sup\analog

Make a safety copy of : ap3_analog.cpp to a place outside this library (rename will fail compile !!)
copy the new ap3_analog.cpp from this package to this folder
