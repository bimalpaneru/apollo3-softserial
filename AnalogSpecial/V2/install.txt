******** INSTALLATION ****************************

On my linux system in the folder :  ~/.arduino15/packages/SparkFun/hardware/apollo3/2.2.1/cores/arduino/mbed-bridge/core-extend
On Windows I would expect <userdir>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\Sparkfun\hardware\apollo3\2.2.1\cores\arduino\mbed-bridge\core-extend

Make a safety copy of : Common.h to a place outside this library (rename will fail compile !!)
copy the new Common.h from this package to this folder

On my linux system in the folder : ~/.arduino15/packages/SparkFun/hardware/apollo3/2.2.1/cores/arduino/sdk/core-implement
On Windows I would expect <userdir>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\Sparkfun\hardware\apollo3\2.2.1\cores\arduino\sdk\core-implement

Make a safety copy of : CommonAnalog.cpp to a place outside this library (rename will fail compile !!)
copy the new CommonAnalog.cpp from this package to this folder
